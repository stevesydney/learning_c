#include <stdio.h>

/*
    Write a program to check a C program
    for rudimentary syntax like
    unbalanced parentheses, brackets
    and braces. Don't forget about
    qoutes, both single and double,
    escape sequences, and comments.
    (This program is hard if you do
    it in full generality.)
